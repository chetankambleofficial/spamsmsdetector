# SMS/Email Spam Classifier

This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to classify SMS and email messages as either "Spam" or "Not Spam." It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to preprocess text and predict spam using a trained model. The app is built with **Streamlit** for an intuitive, interactive interface.
